\section*{Executive Overview}
This document presents an investment opportunity in Great Wall, a company with the only mission to solve the single biggest unsolved problem in cryptocurrency: the ``\$5 wrench attack.'' and the epidemic of obscurity as safety it generates.

\textbf{The problem:} \par
As self-custody becomes mainstream as captured by the trend ``Not your keys, not your coins'', users are increasingly vulnerable to physical threats and coercion.
Great Wall makes it impossible for a user to be forced, under duress, to give up their assets.

We envision a future where customers can stop hiding behind (actual) masks and proudly declare ownership of their cryptocurrency without fear.

\textbf{The solution:} \par
Our solution is a novel ``proof-of-delay'' security model. We've created a digital \textbf{``tacit puzzle''} that must be solved to access a wallet. This puzzle has two unique properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{It requires time-intensive computation to ``load''}—a process that is impossible to accelerate.
    \item \textbf{It requires the user's tacit knowledge}—a piece of information that is ``impossible to be spoken'' or written down, existing only in the user's mind.
\end{itemize}

This built-in delay (from hours to days, set by the user) means that even under threat, a victim \textit{cannot} cooperate with an attacker in real-time. 
This simple, elegant solution neutralizes the wrench attack entirely, and critically, it works even if the attacker knows the full security scheme (no need for obscurity).

\textbf{Monetization:} \par
We are capturing this market with two distinct, high-margin revenue streams:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Marketplace (Subscription):} An anonymous, recurring-revenue marketplace connecting Users (who need security) with Providers (who sell idle computation).
    \item \textbf{The Hardware (One-Time Sale):} A self-sovereign device for technical users who prefer to run the computation locally.
\end{itemize}

Our marketplace is built on a capital-efficient viral loop. Providers incentivized for affiliate commission and growth of client base naturally recruit Users, creating a powerful growth engine that dramatically lowers our Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) compared to any competitor.

\textbf{Bonus:} \par
Swagger merchandise: Branded apparel and accessories that build community, enhance brand loyalty, and offset CAC.
More importantly, it signals to the potential attackers that the owner is security-conscious and not an easy target.
This discourages attacks from ever starting in the first place.

We believe this will create a virtuous cycle of community pride, growth, brand loyalty, and market dominance.

\textbf{The investment opportunity:} \par
We are seeking a \$200,000 seed round to launch the marketplace platform. This will be followed by a \$600,000 Series A to develop our hardware line after achieving significant traction on the Marketplace. This staged funding allows us to build a scalable, high-margin subscription business while simultaneously capturing the self-sovereign hardware market, targeting a \$XX.XM valuation by Year 3.
