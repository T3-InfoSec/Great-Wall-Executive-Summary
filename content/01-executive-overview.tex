\section*{Executive Overview}
This document presents an investment opportunity in Great Wall, a company whose mission is to solve the single biggest unsolved problem in cryptocurrency\textemdash the ``\$5 wrench attack''\textemdash and the fragility created by obscurity-based security approaches.

\textbf{The problem:} \par
As self-custody becomes mainstream as captured by the trend ``Not your keys, not your coins'', users are increasingly vulnerable to physical threats and coercion.
Great Wall makes it impossible for a user to be forced, under duress, to give up their assets.

We envision a future where customers can move from hiding in fear to declaring their security with loud, proud confidence.

\textbf{The solution:} \par
Our solution is a novel protocol we call \textbf{Tacit Knowledge-Based Authentication (TKBA)}. It is the first and only system designed to simultaneously satisfy four crucial security properties that, until now, have been mutually exclusive:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Knowledge-Based (Deviceless):} Access is tied only to the user's mind (their tacit knowledge), not a physical device, seed phrase, or object that can be stolen or seized.
    \item \textbf{Individual Custody:} Upholds the core crypto promise: 'Not your keys, not your coins.' The user remains their own bank, with no reliance on third-party custodians.
    \item \textbf{Anti-Obscurity (Anti-Fragile):} Obscurity is fragile; anti-obscurity is anti-fragile. TKBA is anti-obscure. Its security *increases* as attackers learn more about the protocol, as this knowledge acts as a primary deterrent against attacks that cannot succeed.
    \item \textbf{Coercion Resistance:} The protocol's architecture (requiring both time and tacit knowledge) makes it impossible for an attacker to gain access by force, neutralizing the \$5 wrench attack.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Differentials:} \par
This unique combination of four properties sets Great Wall apart from all existing solutions, each of which suffers from a critical, and often dangerous, flaw.

\textbf{Monetization:} \par
We are capturing this market via a high-margin subscription marketplace connecting Users (who need security) with Providers (who sell idle computation).

Our marketplace's growth is fueled by a provider-driven referral program. Providers are incentivized via affiliate commission to act as a highly-motivated, zero-base-cost sales force. They naturally recruit Users, creating a powerful and scalable growth engine that dramatically lowers our Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).

\textbf{Loud, Proud Apparel (Hybrid Model):} \par
A two-tiered approach combining deterrent marketing with community engagement. Primary deterrent items (stickers/decals) are given away as marketing expenses to maximize adoption and create the "yard sign" network effect. Premium apparel is available through a separate "Superfan Store" for revenue generation. This serves as bonus revenue excluded from primary financial projections.

We believe this will create a virtuous cycle of loud, proud community confidence, exponential growth, brand loyalty, and market dominance.

\textbf{The investment opportunity:} \par
We are seeking a \$\numint{round(\seedAmount/1000,0)}K seed round to launch and scale the marketplace platform toward a \num{\targetValHigh}M valuation by Year 3.
