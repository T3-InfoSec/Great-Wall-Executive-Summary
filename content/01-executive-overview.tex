\section*{Executive Overview}
This document presents a comprehensive valuation model for a Bitcoin security company operating an anonymous computation marketplace. The company (Mark) connects computation providers (Patrick) with clients (Charlie) through three revenue streams: platform fees from recurring computation services, one-time hardware sales for self-sovereign users, and branded merchandise that enhances brand loyalty and offsets customer acquisition costs. 

The financial model employs a competitive platform fee structure of \markPlatformFeePercent\%, which funds anonymous matchmaking infrastructure, reputation systems, and dispute resolution. This positions us alongside successful marketplaces like Uber (25\%) and Fiverr (20\%), while remaining below premium service providers. Our key economic advantage lies not in fee structure but in customer acquisition efficiency: providers naturally recruit clients to grow their own revenue, reducing our marketing costs to \$80-150k annually compared to the \$200-400k typical for marketplaces at our scale\cite{andreessen2020,bvp2023}. This alignment between provider incentives and platform growth creates a sustainable competitive advantage.

The model requires two funding rounds: a \$\numint{\seedAmount} seed round for marketplace platform development, followed by a \$\numint{\seriesAAmount} Series A for hardware development. With strategic partnership enabling market consolidation, the model targets \num{\targetShareSubs}\% of the subscription SAM (comparable to Coinbase, Stripe, LastPass penetration rates) and \num{\targetShareHw}\% of hardware SAM (aligned with YubiKey, Ledger market shares), projecting a path to \$\num{\targetValLow}--\num{\targetValHigh}M valuation by Year \num{3}.
