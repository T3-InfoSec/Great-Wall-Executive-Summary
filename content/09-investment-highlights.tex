\section{Key Investment Highlights}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item \textbf{Solves the \#1 Barrier to Self-Custody:} Addresses the ``\$5 wrench attack,'' the visceral, unsolved problem that prevents mainstream crypto adoption.
    
    \item \textbf{Building the 'Proudly Safe' Movement:} Our core purpose is to disrupt the culture of fear. By moving the market from 'hide in the shadows' to 'proudly safe,' we give users the confidence to embrace self-custody, accelerating crypto adoption and uniting them as part of this mission.
    
    \item \textbf{Creates a ``Deterrent'' Movement:} The merchandise is a desirable strategic asset primarily because it's a social deterrent. It informs potential attackers that the user is protected (and not an easy target). As a consequence of this desirability, it significantly reduces CAC (with a \numint{\merchAttachRate}\% attach rate) and builds a proud, visible community, driving a virtuous cycle of growth and security.

    \item \textbf{Capital-Efficient Growth Engine:} Our growth is fueled by an aggressive provider-driven referral program starting as 20\% commission lifetime until we reach the mark of 20k paying customers to guarantee first mover advantage.

    \item \textbf{Exceptional Unit Economics:} This provider-driven growth, combined with a \num{\cacReductionPercent}\% CAC offset from merchandise, delivers outstanding LTV:CAC ratios of \numint{\subLTV/(\cacDigital - \merchOffsetSubsCalc)}:\numint{1}.

    \item \textbf{Defensible Network Effects:} As the first-mover, our marketplace builds a powerful moat. A growing base of reputable, anonymous providers creates value that competitors cannot easily replicate.
    
    \item \textbf{The Staged Investment Opportunity:} This is a clear, staged path to a \$XX.XM valuation. The \textbf{\$200,000 Seed} funds the scalable, high-margin marketplace. Traction and revenue from Phase 1 will de-risk a \textbf{Series A} to scale the marketplace and ecosystem.
