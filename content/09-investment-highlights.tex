\section{Key Investment Highlights}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item \textbf{Solves the \#1 Barrier to Self-Custody:} Addresses the ``\$5 wrench attack,'' the visceral, unsolved problem that prevents mainstream crypto adoption.
    
    \item \textbf{Building the 'Proudly Safe' Movement:} Our core purpose is to disrupt the culture of fear. By moving the market from 'hide in the shadows' to 'proudly safe,' we give users the confidence to embrace self-custody, accelerating crypto adoption and uniting them as part of this mission.
    
    \item \textbf{Creates a ``Deterrent'' Movement:} The merchandise is a desirable strategic asset primarily because it's a social deterrent. It informs potential attackers that the user is protected (and not an easy target). As a consequence of this desirability, it significantly reduces CAC (with a \numint{\merchAttachRate}\% attach rate) and builds a proud, visible community, driving a virtuous cycle of growth and security.

    \item \textbf{Two-Pillar Market Domination:} The dual-revenue model is designed to capture the \textit{entire} \num{\combinedTAMk}k-person market:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Marketplace (Phase 1):} Scalable, high-margin recurring subscription revenue.
        \item \textbf{Hardware (Phase 2):} High-margin, one-time sales for self-sovereign users.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Capital-Efficient Growth Engine:} Our growth is fueled by a provider-driven referral program. Providers are incentivized via commission to act as a highly-motivated, zero-base-cost sales force, creating a scalable and predictable path to profitability.

    \item \textbf{Exceptional Unit Economics:} This provider-driven growth, combined with a \num{\cacReductionPercent}\% CAC offset from merchandise, delivers outstanding LTV:CAC ratios of \numint{\subLTV/(\cacDigital - \merchOffsetSubsCalc)}:\numint{1} for subscriptions and \numint{\hwWeightedAvgGP/(\cacEvents - \merchOffsetHwCalc)}:\numint{1} for hardware.

    \item \textbf{Defensible Network Effects:} As the first-mover, our marketplace builds a powerful moat. A growing base of reputable, anonymous providers creates value that competitors cannot easily replicate.
    
    \item \textbf{The Staged Investment Opportunity:} This is a clear, staged path to a \$XX.XM valuation. The \textbf{\$200,000 Seed} funds the scalable, high-margin marketplace. Traction and revenue from Phase 1 will de-risk and fund the \textbf{\$600,000 Series A} for the hardware line, creating a capital-efficient rocket ship.
