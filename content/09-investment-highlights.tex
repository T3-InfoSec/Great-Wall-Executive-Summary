\section{Key Investment Highlights}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Solves the \#1 Fear in Self-Custody:} Addresses the ``\$5 wrench attack,'' the visceral, unsolved problem that prevents mainstream crypto adoption. We are creating a new market for users who want to be "proudly safe."

    \item \textbf{A New, Defensible Security Primitive:} The ``Proof-of-Delay'' and ``Tacit Puzzle'' solution is a unique, patentable invention that makes threats useless (no obscurity needed).

    \item \textbf{Creates a "Deterrent" Movement:} The high-attach-rate (\num{\merchAttachRate}\%) merchandise is a key strategic asset. Besides significantly offsetting the CAC, it's a social signal that \textit{deters attacks} by showing the owner is not an easy target, creating a virtuous cycle of community and security.

    \item \textbf{Two-Pillar Market Domination:} The dual-revenue model is designed to capture the \textit{entire} \num{\combinedTAMk}k-person market:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Marketplace (Phase 1):} Scalable, high-margin recurring subscription revenue.
        \item \textbf{Hardware (Phase 2):} High-margin, one-time sales for self-sovereign users.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Capital-Efficient Viral Growth Engine:} The marketplace is built on a provider-driven viral loop. Providers act as a zero-cost, commission-incentivized sales force, which creates our path to profitability.

    \item \textbf{Exceptional Unit Economics:} This viral growth, combined with a \num{\cacReductionPercent}\% CAC offset from merchandise, delivers outstanding LTV:CAC ratios of \numint{\subLTV/(\cacDigital - \merchOffsetSubsCalc)}:\numint{1} for subscriptions and \numint{\hwWeightedAvgGP/(\cacEvents - \merchOffsetHwCalc)}:\numint{1} for hardware.

    \item \textbf{Defensible Network Effects:} As the first-mover, our marketplace builds a powerful moat. A growing base of reputable, anonymous providers creates value that competitors cannot easily replicate.
    
    \item \textbf{The Staged Investment Opportunity:} This is a clear, staged path to a \$XX.XM valuation. The \textbf{\$200,000 Seed} funds the scalable, high-margin marketplace. Traction and revenue from Phase 1 will de-risk and fund the \textbf{\$600,000 Series A} for the hardware line, creating a capital-efficient rocket ship.
