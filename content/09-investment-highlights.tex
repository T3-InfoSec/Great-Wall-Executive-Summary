\section{Key Investment Highlights}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item \textbf{Solves the \#1 Barrier to Self-Custody:} Addresses the wrench attack, the visceral, unsolved problem that prevents mainstream crypto adoption.
    
    \item \textbf{Building the Loud, Proud, and Free Movement:} Our core purpose is to disrupt the culture of fear. By moving the market from hide in the shadows to loud, proud, and free, we give users the confidence to embrace self-custody, accelerating crypto adoption and uniting them as part of this mission.
    
    \item \textbf{Creates a ``Confident Security'' Movement:} The loud apparel is a desirable strategic asset primarily because it signals confident security preparedness. It makes potential attackers understand that users are protected and confident. This builds a loud, proud visible community, driving a virtuous cycle of growth and collective security confidence.

    \item \textbf{Capital-Efficient Growth Engine:} Our growth is fueled by an aggressive provider-driven referral program starting as 20\% commission lifetime until we reach the mark of 20k paying customers to guarantee first mover advantage.

    \item \textbf{Exceptional Unit Economics:} This provider-driven growth delivers outstanding LTV:CAC ratios of \numint{\subLTV/(\cacDigital)}:\numint{1}.

    \item \textbf{Defensible Network Effects:} As the first-mover, our marketplace builds a powerful moat. A growing base of reputable, anonymous providers creates value that competitors cannot easily replicate.
    
    \item \textbf{The Staged Investment Opportunity:} This is a clear, staged path to a \num{\targetValHigh}M valuation. The \textbf{\$\numint{round(\seedAmount/1000,0)}K Seed} funds the scalable marketplace. Traction from Phase 1, combined with our protocol-driven ``Loud, Proud'' movement, drives brand-led acquisition, improves conversion and retention, and reinforces CAC efficiency---de-risking and supporting a \textbf{Series A} to scale the marketplace and ecosystem.

    \item \textbf{Resistant to AI Bubble:} Our valuation and growth are driven by fundamental, verifiable protocol security and marketplace economics (computation/subscriptions), not by speculative AI hype. This provides a durable, defensible investment independent of the AI market's volatility.

    \item \textbf{Resistant to Semiconductor Volatility:} The dual product strategy provides natural resistance to semiconductor price volatility—rising hardware costs drive cloud adoption while falling costs improve device margins, creating countercyclical revenue stabilization.
