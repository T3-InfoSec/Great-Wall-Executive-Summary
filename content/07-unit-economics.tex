\subsection{Key Economic Insights}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Subscription Economics:} High gross margins (95\%) due to minimal direct costs for matchmaking platform
    \item \textbf{Competitive Platform Fee:} \markPlatformFeePercent\% take rate aligns with industry leaders (Uber 25\%, Fiverr 20\%, Amazon 15-45\%)\cite{uber2023,fiverr2023,amazon2024}
    \item \textbf{Customer Acquisition Efficiency:} Our platform design creates natural viral growth through provider incentives. Industry benchmarks show marketplaces typically spend \$35-50 per customer acquired\cite{andreessen2020}, while our blended CAC is just \$\cacDigital. This efficiency stems from providers actively recruiting clients to increase their own revenue - a dynamic documented in successful platforms like Uber (drivers recruiting riders) and Airbnb (hosts encouraging bookings \cite{kumar2018,nfx2018}.
    Includes the free gift effect (\num{\freeMerchanCacReductionPercent}\% CAC reduction) observed in case studies\cite{snappy2024}.
    
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Provider-Driven Growth Economics}
Academic research on two-sided platforms demonstrates that when supply-side participants directly benefit from demand growth, customer acquisition costs can decrease by 40-70\% compared to traditional advertising\cite{parker2016}. In our model, providers who recruit just one additional client increase their monthly revenue by \$17-170 (depending on tier), creating powerful organic growth incentives. This dynamic explains why our \$80-150k annual marketing budgets achieve growth rates comparable to marketplaces spending \$200-400k\cite{bvp2023}.

\subsection{Cohort Economics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Customer Lifetime:} Average \numfpeval{round(\ltvYearsUsed, 1)} years (capped at \num{\ltvCapYears} years)
    \item \textbf{Churn Improvement:} From \num{\churnYearOne}\% to \num{\churnYearThree}\% annually
    \item \textbf{Revenue Retention:} Strong unit retention with growing revenue per user through tier upgrades
\end{itemize}
