\section{Business Model: Marketplace + CAC Optimization}

\subsection{Revenue Stream Segmentation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Subscriptions:} Anonymous marketplace for recurring memory-intensive computation services
  \item \textbf{Merchandise (Community Engagement):} Branded items sold via a separate 'Superfan Store' to engage our most passionate users. This is treated as a bonus revenue stream and is not included in the primary financial projections.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Subscription Service: Anonymous Computation Marketplace}
The subscription service operates as a computation matchmaking \textbf{marketplace} connecting:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Clients:} Users needing recurring memory-intensive computation without owning adequate hardware - anonymity critical for privacy
  \item \textbf{Providers:} PC owners monetizing idle computational capacity - can operate publicly to attract clients
\end{itemize}
Platform provides anonymous client matching, reputation system, and dispute arbitration.

Key marketplace dynamics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Computation jobs are simple but, by design, memory-intensive, lengthy and Clients demand for them is recurrent
  \item Anonymity is critical for Clients, while Providers can promote services openly
  \item We align provider success with platform growth. An aggressive referral commission incentivizes providers to recruit clients, transforming them into a highly-motivated, capital-efficient sales force \cite{parker2016}.
  \item First-mover advantage critical to build reputable user base before competitors
  \item Tiers differentiate by computation duration: \numint{\computeHoursBasic}, \numint{\computeHoursMedium}, \numint{\computeHoursProfessional} and \numint{\computeHoursGolden} hours
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textit{SAM refers to the Serviceable Available Market for subscription users. Free (self-hosted) users are excluded from SAM and related financial projections for simplicity. Merchandise is treated solely as community engagement and is not included in financial projections.}
